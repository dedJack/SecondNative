# 📱 secondNative – React Native Learning Repo

This repository contains all the React Native features, animations, and functionalities I’ve learned and practiced so far. It is a hands-on learning space where I implemented everything from gesture handling to animations using Reanimated.

---

## 🧠 What I’ve Learned So Far

### 🧹 Reanimated (v2+)
- `useSharedValue`, `useAnimatedStyle`, `withTiming`, `withSpring`, `withDecay`
- `interpolate`, `interpolateColor`
- Animated transitions and responsive animations
- Drag-based animation handling with shared values

### 🖐️ Gesture Handling
- `react-native-gesture-handler`
  - `PanGestureHandler` for drag interactions
  - `TapGestureHandler`, `LongPressGestureHandler`
- Used `GestureDetector` and `Gesture` API from Reanimated v3+
- Independent gestures per FlatList item
- Drag-to-delete interaction with visual feedback

### ⬆️ Interactions & UI Effects
- Pull to refresh using FlatList’s `onRefresh` and `refreshing` props
- Custom gesture zones (like deleting by dragging to a specific area)
- Smooth animation control with `interpolate`

### 🔗 API Integration
- **Data fetching using:**
  - `fetch` API (native)
  - `axios` (third-party)
- State management and dynamic rendering of data from APIs

### 📆 State & Component Management
- React Hooks: `useState`, `useEffect`
- Context API for managing global state
- Modular file organization and reusable components
- Conditional rendering and component-based layouts

### 🧱 Architecture & Structure
- Practiced clean structure inside the `secondNative` repo
- All features, gestures, and animations are organized and separated into files/modules
- Each feature implemented with real code, not tutorials only

## ⚖️ Work in Progress
This is a growing project. As I explore more React Native libraries, animation patterns, and API integrations, I will continue updating this repository.

## 📌 Tech Stack

- React Native
- React Native Reanimated
- React Native Gesture Handler
- Axios
- React Context API

## 🏁 Goal

The main goal of this repo is to master animation and interaction patterns in React Native by building small, focused features and utilities — preparing for real-world mobile app development.
